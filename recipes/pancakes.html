        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces <strong>thick, fluffy,</strong> and all-around <strong><em>delicious</em></strong> pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
